## Live Project: [https://next-event-m66hkk294-mstfakks.vercel.app/](https://next-event-m66hkk294-mstfakks.vercel.app/)

## Project Description
The event web application has been developed using Next.js. In this application, you can browse through events, view event details, and add your comments to relevant events. Additionally, you can observe comments posted by other users.

## Getting Started

First, clone this code in your workspace, after install dependecies and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage
When you launch the application, you will be greeted with the homepage displaying featured events and a sign-up section with an option to register using your email. User registration is done through email, and the mail information is stored in MongoDB. Clicking on "Browse All Events" will redirect you to the /events page where all events are listed. On this page, you can apply filters based on month and year to refine your search. By selecting "Explore Event," you can read the details of a specific event and leave your comments on it.
